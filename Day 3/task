Welcome to your Lesson 3 - Challenge 3

In the last challenge, we began removing the placeholder text and started adding some of the elements we needed for our recipe

You now have the following elements in place

    The recipe name
    The recipe description
    The ingredients heading
    The list of ingredients

In this challenge, we will add some more of the HTML elements that are required.

In particular, you will add:

    The preparation heading
    The preparation steps
    The copyright text

Result

Your result should look similar to the image below (but with your own recipe text content):

Steps

    Replace the recipe name, ingredients heading, and ingredients list with the text you added to the last challenge
    Add a <h2> element to the second <section>, and text of your choice
    Add an <ol> element to the second <section>
    The < ol > should contain at least 4 <li> element listing your recipe instructions.
    The < footer > element should contain a <p> element with the text: Copyright Me 2020

Tips

If you're stuck, the Recipe: Headings and lists video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!
