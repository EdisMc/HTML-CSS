 Welcome to your Lesson 2 Challenge 3
Every HTML element can be assigned a unique identifier. This is done by including an id attribute and its associated value in the element's opening tag. Element ids should be unique to each element on a page. They should also be given a meaningful name that describes what the element is being used for. We can use CSS to target an id
 
In particular, you will:

    Add an id and its value to a div element
    Add an id and its value to the div's child paragraph element
    You'll then target these ids with unique styles

Result
Your result should look like the image below:
 
Steps

A style rule that targets the div has already been created for you. You will need to create the second style rule to target the paragraph

    Add an id attribute to the < div > element and give it the value " heading" . Our #heading style rule will now target that div
    Add an id attribute to the <p> element within the < div > element, give it the value " uppercase"
    Create a style rule on line 14 that has an id selector name of #uppercase. This will target our paragraph
    Within that rule add a declaration that sets the text-transform property to uppercase

Tips
If you're stuck, the Targeting An Individual video will give you everything you need to succeed.
