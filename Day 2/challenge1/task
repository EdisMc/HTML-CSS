 Welcome to your Lesson 2 - Challenge 1
In particular, you will:

    style a <h1> element
    style a <p> element
    style an <em> element
    style a <strong> element

You'll do this by using element selectors (style rules that have the same selector names as the HTML elements they are targeting).
In this challenge, each style rule will contain one style declaration that will target its associated HTML element.
Result
Your result should look like the image below
 
Steps
As you can see in the edit panel to the left, we have already started this for you by

    creating a style rule for the <body> element, using its HTML Element selector name
    creating a declaration giving it a font-size property
    setting the property value to 14px

    Create an h1 style rule within the < style > element and below the body
    Set the  h1 rule color property to gold . - Note the US spelling of color -
    Create a p rule below the h1 rule
    Set the p rule color property to darkslategray
    Create an em rule below the p rule
    Set the em rule font-size property to 20px
    Create a strong rule below the em rule
    Set the strong rule font-size property to 24px

Tips
As you might imagine, specifying a color by its name can be restricting given the millions of colours available to us on our screens.

    Do a web search to find out other ways of specifying color.
    In particular look at how hex and RGB color is used in CSS
    Why do we recommend searching? Well, at least once a day, even the most experienced developer will search the web looking for a solution to a problem they need to solve.
    Knowing how to fine-tune your internet search words and phrases is a skill every developer needs to have
