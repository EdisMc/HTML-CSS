Welcome to Lesson 2 - Challenge 4
Every HTML element can be assigned a class identifier. This is done by including a class attribute and its associated value in the element's opening tag . Elements that are conceptually grouped in some way can be given the same class attribute value . They should also be given a meaningful name that describes what the element grouping is being used for. We can use CSS to target class attributes and apply a collective style to those elements.

In the last challenge, you applied id styling to a Sporting History web page. In particular, you:

    Added an id and its value to a div element
    Added an id and its value to the div's child paragraph element
    You then targeted these ids with unique styles

This challenge will build upon the previous one.
In particular, you will:

    Group and style the sports-related content on your web page
    Group and style programming-related content on your web page

Result
Your result should look like the image below.
 
Steps

    Add a class attribute to the first two <h3> elements and give each of them the attribute value of sports-history
    Add a class attribute to the second two <h3> elements and give each of them the attribute value of computing-history
    Create a style rule beneath the existing id rules that has a corresponding class selector name of sports-history. This will target our sports content
    Within that rule, add a declaration that sets the color property to orange
    Create another style rule has a corresponding class selector name of computing-history. This will target our programming content
    Within that rule add a declaration that sets the color property to green

If you're stuck, the Targeting A Group video will give you everything you need to succeed.
